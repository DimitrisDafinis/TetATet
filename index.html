<p>&emsp;This application targets small groups of people with the need to communicate with each other in absolute secrecy.</p>

<p>&emsp;Some unique capabilities include:
  <ul>
  <li>&emsp;Direct, one-to-one contact. The two users communicate directly with each other.</li><br />

  <li>&emsp;Each user's device is connected to the same or different wifi network, anywhere in the world. One out of the two can also be connected to a mobile network.</li><br />

  <li>&emsp;Completely server-less. There exists no server for either initiating, sustaining or monitoring the communication. The communication software resides exclusively in the devices themselves.</li><br />

  <li>&emsp;Both orally and in writing. Oral communication is self explanatory. The written communication is like old-style telex communication: the typed characters are transmitted one by one, as soon as they are typed. Both sides can write simultaneously.</li><br />

  <li>&emsp;Without any call registration. No record is held anywhere for the conducted communication.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  <p>&emsp;The operating principle is quite simple: A common email account is used where each userâ€™s device sends its public internet IP address. All devices of the group having access to this mailbox can connect to each other by using this information and a custom proprietary communication protocol.</p>

  <p>&emsp;No central server is used, so nobody except the two communicating parties knows that they are communicating. This makes cyphering unnecessary.</p>

  <p>&emsp;The application runs both in iOS and Android devices.</p>
