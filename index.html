  <p>&emsp;This application targets small groups of people with the need to communicate with each other in absolute secrecy.</p>

<p>&emsp;Some unique capabilities include:
  <ul>
  <li>&emsp;Direct, one-to-one contact</li>
  <li>&emsp;Completely server less</li>
  <li>&emsp;Both orally and in writing</li>
  <li>&emsp;Without any call registration</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  <p>&emsp;The logic behind is quite simple: A common email account is used where each userâ€™s device sends its public internet IP address. All devices of the group having access to this mailbox can connect to each other with the use of a custom proprietary communication protocol.</p>

  <p>&emsp;No central server is used, so nobody except the two communicating parties knows that they are communicating.</p>

  <p>&emsp;The application runs both in iOS and Android devices.</p>
