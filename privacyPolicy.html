<p>&emsp;Tête à Tête uses a common email account as a basis where the users' internet IP addresses are stored. This email account is known to all the users of the group.</p>

<p>&emsp;It is recommended that a new account is created specifically for this application. So the messages created by the app will not mix with the users' other email messages. Any normal account in Gmail, Yahoo etc. is suitable.</p>

<p>&emsp;The email account must be created by following the email provider's guidelines. Afterwards, the app password specifically for Tête à Tête has to be created by following these steps:</p>

<p>&emsp;Log in from a browser in your email account and head for the account's Security Settings. There:</p>
<p>(a) Turn on <b>2-step Verification</b>,<br/>
(b) Search for "App Passwords" and create a new <b>app password</b> for Tête à Tête. It is a 16-digit string (without any spaces) which  will be the app password for Tête à Tête.
</p>

<p>&emsp;When the app runs for the first time, you will be asked to enter:
<ul>
<li>Your user name of your choice (e.g. "First User")</li>
<li>Your email account (e.g. "tetatet365@gmail.com") </li>
<li>The app password (e.g. "wmhxdbpgmocuauos")</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>&emsp;Those three information pieces are stored in the internal memory of each user’s device <b>ONLY</b> and are used solely for connecting the apps together. Neither these details nor the user’s activity will ever be sent anywhere.</p>

<p>&emsp;Tête à Tête is completely free for now.</p>

<p>&emsp;It is designed to be used only for legal and acceptable purposes and not to send illegal or impermissible messages.</p>

<p>&emsp;Tête à Tête bases its operation on third-party websites, specially electronic mail companies and their services, e.g. Gmail, Yahoo etc. You will use these services according to their terms and privacy policies. TetATet will not be held responsible for these services.</p>
